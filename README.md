# Silent Build Failure in Expo CLI

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: silent build failures. The build process terminates without providing clear, actionable error messages, making debugging extremely difficult.

## Problem
The Expo CLI build process unexpectedly fails without providing specific details about the error. This often occurs due to subtle configuration issues, dependency conflicts, or problems with native modules.

## Solution
The solution provided focuses on improving debugging strategies and pinpointing the root cause. This usually involves more thorough logging, careful review of dependencies, and systematic troubleshooting to isolate the problematic code or configuration.

## Reproduction Steps (Illustrative)

1.  Ensure you have the Expo CLI installed.
2.  Attempt to build your Expo app using `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios`.
3.  Observe that the build process fails without providing a detailed error message.

## Note
The provided solution is a general approach, as the exact cause and fix depend on the specific circumstances of the silent build failure.  Thorough error logging and iterative debugging are key.
