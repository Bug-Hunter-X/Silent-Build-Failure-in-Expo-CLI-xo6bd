This error typically occurs during the build process of an Expo app and is often related to misconfigurations in your project setup or dependencies.  It manifests as cryptic error messages that don't directly pinpoint the source. The build process fails silently, leaving you with no clear indication of what went wrong.  Example error messages might involve bundling errors, native module issues, or difficulties with asset processing, often without specific file paths.
